The parameter \"p\" represents the order of autoregression, indicating how many past time steps to consider.\n",

        "1. **Stationarity:**\n",
        "   - **Assumption:** ARIMA models assume that the time series data is stationary, meaning that its statistical properties remain constant over time. This includes a constant mean, constant variance, and constant autocorrelation structure.\n",
        "   - **Testing:** To test for stationarity, you can visually inspect the time series plot for trends and seasonality. Additionally, statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test can be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Independence:**\n",

        "   - **Testing:** You can visually inspect autocorrelation plots (ACF) and partial autocorrelation plots (PACF) to check for any significant autocorrelation, which may indicate violations of this assumption.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - **Testing:** You can use normality tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or visually inspect a histogram of the residuals. If the residuals significantly deviate from a normal distribution, it may indicate a violation of this assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Linearity:**\n",
        "   - **Assumption:** ARIMA models assume a linear relationship between past observations and the current observation.\n",
        "   - **Testing:** Visual inspection of the time series plot and residual plots can help identify nonlinear patterns. Nonlinearity might require more complex models beyond ARIMA.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - **Assumption:** ARIMA assumes that there are no outliers in the time series data.\n",

        "Ans = ### **Stationary Time Series:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A stationary time series is one where statistical properties, such as the mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time.\n",
        "- In a stationary series, the data points are not dependent on the specific time at which they are observed, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships.\n",
        "- Stationary series are often preferred for time series modeling because they simplify the choice of forecasting models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Non-Stationary Time Series:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A non-stationary time series is one where statistical properties change over time. This can manifest as trends, seasonality, or other time-dependent patterns.\n",
        "- Non-stationary series have changing means, variances, or covariances, making it challenging to model and predict future values accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Impact on Forecasting Models:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The stationarity of a time series significantly affects the choice of forecasting models:\n",
        "  - Stationary series are suitable for traditional models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), which assume constant statistical properties.\n",
        "  - Non-stationary series often require differencing or transformation to become stationary before applying ARIMA or similar models.\n",
        "  - Specialized models like seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) or exponential smoothing methods may be preferred for non-stationary series with clear seasonality."
